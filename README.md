# Discord-Embed-Sending-Selfbot
Discord Embed Sending Selfbot (feat. aiko-chan-ai's WebEmbed)
In addition to the feature where users can send Discord embeds using aiko-chan-ai's WebEmbed link, 
this allows you to use a self-bot to automatically input the embed link easily.
Please note that if the aiko-chan-ai's WebEmbed service is discontinued, the code will also stop working.
Most API calls for Discord self-bots are blocked, 
and making such calls risks having the account associated with the token you used disabled by Discord. 
Therefore, it is recommended to use them only for learning purposes.
